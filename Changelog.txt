--Wishlist:
		New UI
[DONE]	Custom rainbow colour scheme (e.g. blue on the top, red on the bottom)
[WIP]	Performance improvements
[WIP]	Rewind and playback without wrong MIDI CC and “falls” disappearance (they are actually not bugs in the current version)
[DONE]	Vertical view
[DONE]	Custom resolution
		Better way to display overlapped notes
		Option to delay the display to synchronize with the sound (for those MIDI synth that the sound playback latency is obvious)
		Output video with alpha channel (need to do more research)
		Option to change the display priority of channels
		Custom skin for notes, keyboard, falls and animation when a note hit the keyboard
		Better project & preference saving/loading


[DONE]	Visualise pitch bends (miditrail style?)
		Optional colour scheme for 16 channels, cycles through hue progressively.
		Showing BPM,time,beats,etc.
		Add FPS Monitor
		Increase Note Length Scale to 8
		Send SysEx string to current MIDI device (a box to type some hex values in, like the one for GM Reset, etc). Why? Good for MIDIs which dont have any SysEx but require instrument resets/specific playing modes on hard synths.
